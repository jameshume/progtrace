# Program Execution Tracing
Use GCC function call tracing callbacks and BFD to trace program execution, function by function.

Partially based on [EmbeddedFreedom's article on tracing and profiling function calls with GCC](https://balau82.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/trace-and-profile-function-calls-with-gcc/) and [addr2line.c](https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/binutils/blob/master/binutils/addr2line.c).
